    -The navigation section
    -The section with your name and pictures
    -Sections that relate to About, Experience, 
        Education, Skills & Endorsements, etc.
    -The page does not need the ads, people also 
        viewed, or skills remade on the right of the 
        page, but you should have a section that 
        would have those.
    -You do not need to add links to other pages
